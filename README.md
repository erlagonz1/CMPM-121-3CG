<h2>Final Project Postmortem (written as a pair):</h2>

Overall, this project went well and we think that it was a smooth process. We believe that this is due to a few reasons. First, we had a plan that helped us navigate the changes that we wanted to implement. This helped guide our focus and made us be on the same page in regards to which part we were each working on. Due to this, we were able to complete many improvements to the game, such as adding a title screen, end screen, pop-up notifications for card effects, background music, sound effects, etc. Another reason that the project turned out well is because we have worked together before. We have experience working on games together in past classes, so we know how each other work, what the other person is good at, and how to play off each other's strengths. Lastly, we are both very communication-focused people, which is key to good teamwork.

We are proud of the technical improvements we added, such as being able to add in new programming patterns (event queue for notification manager). However, we are more proud of the fact that we were able to do the work almost seamlessly as a cohesive team. When we have worked together in the past, this has been an aspect that we have constantly improved upon, and will continue to do so in the future.

The biggest area for future improvement on this project is the aesthetics. All of the game balancing (cost, power) can be easily tweaked to make the game more balanced and fun, but we want to entice the player visually. Right now, the basic structure of the game is good, as all of the moving parts are working together nicely. However, we can do more work on making the title screen and end screen more visually appealing, such as adding art and clean transitions. Another thing we want to implement is "revealing" the cards slowly, one by one as if you were to play the game in person. This would involve making some nice animations to add to the card flip and notifications.

Lastly, we would both like to work on something like this again in the future, as it was fun and helped us develop teamwork skills. In fact, we have actually talked about improving this game beyond the scope of the project, and it's something that we plan to discuss more this summer.
